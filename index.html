You are welcome to contribute and improve these projects.<br>
I did no optimisation, only got it to work<br>
So there is a lot of glue everywhere<br>
The code definitely need refactoring for which I do not have time<br>

But If you find any bugs let me know<br>
By opening an issue to the given project.
